    <h2>üß† About</h2>
    <p>Masked Z√ÜLS is the first emotionally forged NFT protocol on HYPERLIQUID, grounded in the energy of those who never left.</p>
    <p>This isn't hype.<br>This is history.</p>
    <p>We're building a scalable brand, designed for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bridging Web2 trauma with Web3 trust</li>
      <li>Telling stories that feel real because they are</li>
      <li>Rewarding loyalty in a space that forgot what it meant</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Born from pain.<br>Built with purpose.<br>Run by survivors.</p>
    <p>This is not just a project.<br>This is a movement.<br>And you're part of it.</p>

  <section id="lore" data-aos="zoom-in-up">
    <h2>üìñ LORE | The Ones Who Stayed</h2>
    <p>There was a time ‚Äî not long ago ‚Äî when the chain was quiet. And the dreams were louder than the market.</p>
    <p>They came in with hope:<br>A father. A mother. A boy. A girl.<br>Each searching for something bigger.</p>
    <p>They minted. They joined communities. They believed.<br>And then, it all went dark.</p>
    <p>Projects vanished. Friends turned to flippers. Hope became loss.</p>
    <p>The father stopped speaking. The mother ignored her wallet. The boy grew cold. The girl cried in silence.</p>
    <p>And just when it felt like it was over ‚Äî it appeared.</p>
    <p><strong>The Mask.</strong><br>Not a savior. Not a promise.<br>Just truth reflected in silence.</p>
    <p>The Mask didn‚Äôt lie. It didn‚Äôt hype. It showed them that others stayed. That they weren‚Äôt alone. That survivors existed ‚Äî still holding, still here.</p>
    <p>And one by one, they rose. The masked came together. Quiet. Relentless. True.</p>
    <p>These were the Masked Z√ÜLS. Not the loudest. Not the richest. But the most real.</p>
    <p>They took pain and made protocol. They turned silence into structure. They built for the ones who believed.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="whitepaper" data-aos="zoom-in-up">
    <h2>üìú Whitepaper: Masked Z√ÜLS on HYPERLIQUID</h2>
    <p>Masked Z√ÜLS is a community forged NFT movement powered by HYPERLIQUID ‚Äî born out of betrayal, refined through resilience, and built for the ones who refused to fade.</p>

    <p>Through evolving art, trait-based upgrades, staking rewards, and a deeply integrated DAO, Masked Z√ÜLS rises as a new force on HYPERLIQUID ‚Äî a culture where loyalty isn‚Äôt weakness, it‚Äôs the weapon.</p>

  <section id="why" data-aos="zoom-in-up">
    <h2>üß¨ Why We'll Last</h2>
    <p>Our power isn‚Äôt hype. It‚Äôs identity.</p>
    <p>Masked Z√ÜLS reflects the truth of Web3:<br>That the ones who lost the most‚Ä¶ are the ones who build the strongest.</p>
    <p>We‚Äôve taken what others called a flaw ‚Äî loyalty, patience, belief ‚Äî and turned it into our ecosystem‚Äôs backbone.</p>
    <p>This isn‚Äôt a trend.<br>It‚Äôs a transformation.</p>
    <p>We‚Äôre building across content, gamification, and narrative-rich layers of HYPERLIQUID ‚Äî but it all starts with the real ones.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="final" data-aos="zoom-in-up">
